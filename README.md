# EasyDial


This was created as part of a project to help a client physically unable to use a landline phone. My team created a 'speed-dial' of sorts that allowed her to call preset numbers with a small array of buttons on her wheel chair. Pressing a button would send an encrypted signal across the server connection to the other part of the device resting on the landline. The box on the landline would decrypt the signal and dial the corresponding number using push solenoids.
